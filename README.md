Hello!

Welcome to Software Development & Problem Solving I, the first course in a year-long introductory programming sequence with an emphasis on software engineering, incremental development, and testing.

If you are reading this, then you have accepted the invitation to your very first homework assignment. Congratulations! Please read the instructions in the assignment carefully and follow them. 

When you are finished, there is nothing to submit. Your graders will check your repository on GitHub to make sure that you completed the assignment before the deadline. It is very often the case that you will continue to build on your solution to a homework assignment in the next lecture and/or following assignments. For this reason it is important that you complete each assignment before the deadline, which is usually the beginning of the next class. Extensions will not be granted for late homework assignments.

The good news is that, provided that you practice good habits, all of your work will be backed up on GitHub's servers, so you don't need to worry about the proverbial dog eating your homework (or your laptop breaking, losing your external SSD, etc.).

If you have any questions, please contact your instructor!

Good luck and have a great semester!
